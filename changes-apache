changes done while working with apache version

Edit the apache2 config file (it should be under /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf), adding this:

Alias /yourdir /var/www/html/yourdir/public/
<Directory "/var/www/html/yourdir/public">
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
</Directory>

Where "yourdir" is obviously your folder under the /var/www/html path. Restart your server after you modified the config file

sudo service apache2 restart

Now your public/.htaccess should be something like:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /yourdir/

# Redirect Trailing Slashes If Not A Folder...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [L,R=301]

# Authorization Headers
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

# Handle Front Controller...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]

==============================================================================================

	Alias /people /var/www/html/people/public/
	<Directory "/var/www/html/people/public">
	        AllowOverride All
	        Order allow,deny
			Deny from all
	    	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI

			Allow from 127.0.0.1 localhost ::1  
			
	</Directory>


==============================================================================================
sudo service apache2 start

service httpd status httpd

to check all the processes running on port 80
	netstat -plnt | grep ':80'
netstat- netstat is a useful tool for checking your network configuration and activity. It is in fact a collection of several tools lumped together.
 	
inorder to kill the process that is goin on and has beeb bocked.
 	kill -9 (the process that is mentioned in the PID column  	only for deleting the service usee, also for multiople services. services are obtained after doing netstat)

Creating an Apache VirtualHost
Problem
The default Apache web page shows for your project.

You have Apache installed and have created a Laravel project, but the web page returned by your browser is the default Apache web page.

Solution
Create an Apache Virtual Host for your project.

laravel:~$ cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
laravel:/etc/apache2/sites-available$ sudo vi myapp.conf
Have the contents of the file match what's below.

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName myapp.localhost.com
  DocumentRoot "/home/vagrant/projects/myapp/public"
  <Directory "/home/vagrant/projects/myapp/public">
    AllowOverride all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
Save the file, then continue below.

laravel:/etc/apache2/sites-available$ cd ../sites-enabled
laravel:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled$ sudo ln -s ../sites-available/myapp.conf
laravel:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled$ sudo service apache2 restart
Fixing Permissions

If you're running a virtual machine under Vagrant, you may want to change the user and group to avoid permission issues.

To do this:

laravel:~$ cd /etc/apache2
laravel:/etc/apache2$ sudo vi envvars
Change the lines below to contain the desired user and group

export APACHE_RUN_USER=vagrant
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=vagrant
Save the file and restart apache.

laravel:/etc/apache2$ sudo service apache2 restart
Discussion
This solution assumes several things.

Your apache version is the type that places virtual hosts in /etc/apache/sites-*
Your Laravel project is in /home/vagrant/projects/myapp
You have myapp.localhost.com in your hosts file (the host file on your host operating system, where you're browser will run)
If the assumptions above are correct you should be able to point your browser to http://myapp.localhost.com and see your Laravel web application.

====================================

  ServerName testlaravel.com
  DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/people/public"
  <Directory "/var/www/html/people/public">
    AllowOverride all
  </Directory>
