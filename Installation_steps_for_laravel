Installation steps for laravel

1.Install LAMP
check if 
    php >=5.6
     use cmmd : php -v

    OpenSSL php extension
        php -r "echo OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER;"

        PHP OpenSSL is provided as a DLL file called php_openssl.dll. PHP-Openssl is used for generation and verification of signatures and for sealing (encrypting) and opening (decrypting) data. OpenSSL is an open source project that provides a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. It is also a general-purpose cryptography library. 

        
    PDO PHP Extension
        Using command line, for PDO:
        php -m|grep -i pdo

        For PDO with MySQL support:
        php -m|grep -i pdo_mysql

        To install php mysql support, search for the package name (Ubuntu):
        apt-cache search php7*|grep mysql

        And install it if not already did (Ubuntu):
        sudo apt-get install php-mysql


    Mbstring PHP Extension

now incase composer and laravel dnt go together cz composer is upgraded then, following commands help:
sudo composer self-update

sudo composer clear-cahce

sudo composer config -g secure-http false

sudo composer update --no-scripts



git remote -v
helps to check if the remote is connected to the local repo
The repository you're trying to fetch must exist on GitHub, and the URL is case-sensitive.
You can find the URL of the local repository by opening the command line and typing git remote -v:

reinstall ------------- 2.0 ------------------------->>

1. installed :
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdebi
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install filezilla

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer

download the composer as mentioned in their website.
now you can move/copy the composer.phar file to the /usr/local/bin dir so that composer is accessable from anywhere

virtualbox
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

vagrant
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

sudo apt-get install php7.0

in terminal after everything is installed:
vagrant box add laravel/homestead

follow up by selecting one of the options- I have selected virtualbox






now inorder to install laravel :
composer global require "laravel/installer"

run it only once and later only for updating it
Make sure to place the "~/.composer/vendor/bin" directory (or the equivalent directory for your OS) in your PATH so the laravel executable can be located by your system.

sudo apt-get install php7.0-zip
since my php zip extension was missing.

sudo apt-get install php-xml
since php dom extension was missing


homestead: follow the steps written in the doc
 cd ~/.homestead
 subl Homestead.yaml
provider: virtualbox <-- in the file at end 




laravel new project18 
it would create a new laravel empty project by name "project18"

Installing laravel on the server

check for os version running --
lsb_release -a
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.7

check:  php -v : 5.6

apache version running
rpm -q httpd
httpd-2.2.15-45.el6.x86_64

mysql -V
5.5.49


folder create/delete
mkdir folder_name
rm -r -f folder_name

rm -- remove
-r -- remove subfolders/dependencies
-f -- remove by force 
folder_name -- path of the folder from where it has to be removed


For the server since it acts like a virtual m/c , it has its instances, we would not make use of laravel homestead vm instead we would directly install laravel framework on the server m/c

NOTE: login into opr, go for root access 

install git on server

rpm -q qit -- check if its installed else

yum install git

follow it up by going in home/sayali folder

rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

inorder to verify epel repo
yum repolist
