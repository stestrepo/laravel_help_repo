reinstall ------------- 2.0 ------------------------->>

1. installed :
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdebi
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install filezilla

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer

download the composer as mentioned in their website.
now you can move/copy the composer.phar file to the /usr/local/bin dir so that composer is accessable from anywhere

virtualbox
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

vagrant
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

sudo apt-get install php7.0

in terminal after everything is installed:
vagrant box add laravel/homestead

follow up by selecting one of the options- I have selected virtualbox






now inorder to install laravel :
composer global require "laravel/installer"

run it only once and later only for updating it
Make sure to place the "~/.composer/vendor/bin" directory (or the equivalent directory for your OS) in your PATH so the laravel executable can be located by your system.

sudo apt-get install php7.0-zip
since my php zip extension was missing.

sudo apt-get install php-xml
since php dom extension was missing


homestead: follow the steps written in the doc
 cd ~/.homestead
 subl Homestead.yaml
provider: virtualbox <-- in the file at end
